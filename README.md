# Embedded Systems Concepts Project

This project consists of several `main.c` files demonstrating key concepts in embedded systems programming. The goal is to showcase various embedded systems techniques and how they work in practice. 

## Concepts Covered

1. **Tasks and Scheduling**
   - Introduction to task management and scheduling mechanisms.
   - Demonstrates how to create and manage multiple tasks in an embedded system.

2. **Semaphores, Mutexes, and Binary Counting**
   - Synchronization mechanisms like semaphores and mutexes for task coordination.
   - Includes a binary counting example to highlight mutual exclusion.

3. **Priority Inversion and Priority Inheritance**
   - Demonstrates the issue of priority inversion and how priority inheritance resolves it.

4. **Deadlock**
   - Example showing how deadlocks can occur and how they are avoided or resolved.

5. **Task Suspension, Notification, and Resumption**
   - Covers task suspension, notification, and resumption mechanisms for controlling task execution.

6. **Watchdogs**
   - Introduces watchdog timers to reset the system in case of failure or hanging tasks.

7. **Timer Interrupts**
   - Example of using timer interrupts to trigger actions at specific time intervals.

8. **External Interrupts**
   - Explains how external interrupts are handled in embedded systems, with an example.

9. **Task Critical Section**
   - A demonstration of managing critical sections in tasks to prevent data corruption.

10. **Priority Masking**
    - Explains how priority masking is used to temporarily disable interrupts based on task priority.
